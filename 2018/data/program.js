We will review the major components in magic: a clear and possible destination, the use of appropriate symbolism, feeding the spell, following the hints of the universe, and how to know when you get there.  We will discuss how this all plays into major goals in life, and how to apply magic successfully on a larger scale.  While this is a talk about spells, it also confronts our own psychology, helping us to listen to the whispers the world sends us and learn how to get out of our own way.  I have a very common-sense approach, but it also embraces the mystical and magical in every moment.  This talk will encourage all attendees to achieve the same, on their own terms.","loc":["Booth#71"],"tags":["Workshops"],"people":[{"name":"Beth Zimmerman","id":"23"}]}];
